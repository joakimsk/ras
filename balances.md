### Free ammonia vs ammonium
See ![table](https://images.thefishsite.com/fish/legacy/files/articles/old/06-08UFloridaAmmon4.gif)

TAN * factor = free ammonia

Table 1. Fraction of unionized ammonia in aqueous solution at different pH values and temperatures. Calculated from data in Emmerson et al. (1975). To calculate the amount of unionized ammonia present, the Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN) must be multiplied by the appropriate factor selected from this table using the pH and temperature from your water sample. See the example in Figure 3.


### Using the Seneye with micro RAS 11.04.2021
We add 2.8 ml ammonia 9%, to a total of 3 ppm to 80 liters water. We have measured with Seneye which gives a strange reading, but we know that the solution is 3 ppm:

Free Ammonia = 0.172 (according to Seneye)

Temperature is 8 degree Celsius

pH is roughly 7.6 (probably more, up to 8.1, but Seneye says 7.5)

TAN * Factor = Free ammonia

Free ammonia / Factor = TAN

0.172 ppm / Factor = 3 ppm

Factor = 0.172/3 = 0.05733333333 (This factor does not fit any in the table, but we will use it for the time being.)

0.172 (Free ammonia according to Seneye) / 0.0573 (Factor) = 3 ppm (Total Ammonia Nitrogen)

### Using the Seneye with micro RAS 11.04.2021 after 12 hours of mixing
Free Ammonia = 0.124 (according to Seneye)

Temperature is 8 degree Celsius

pH is roughly 7.6 (probably more, up to 8.1, but Seneye says 7.5)

TAN * Factor = Free ammonia

Free ammonia / Factor = TAN

0.124 ppm / Factor = 3 ppm

Factor = 0.124/3 = 0.04133333333 (This factor seems closer to reality, "pH 8.4")

0.124 (Free ammonia according to Seneye) / 0.04133333333 (Factor) = 3 ppm (Total Ammonia Nitrogen)

### Using the Seneye with micro RAS 12.04.2021 after 36 hours of mixing
Free Ammonia = 0.121 (according to Seneye)

Temperature is 8 degree Celsius

pH is roughly 7.6 (probably more, up to 8.1, but Seneye says 7.56)

TAN * Factor = Free ammonia

Free ammonia / Factor = TAN

0.121 ppm / Factor = 3 ppm

Factor = 0.121/3 = 0.04033333333 (This factor seems closer to reality, "pH 8.4")

0.121 (Free ammonia according to Seneye) / 0.04033333333 (Factor) = 3 ppm (Total Ammonia Nitrogen)
